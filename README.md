# Michelle Chekwoti – Data Blog

Welcome to my data blog! 👋

This space is where I break down the logic behind my data projects—from financial modeling and Excel automations to Python analytics and Power BI dashboards. Each post explores the problem, the tools I used, and what I learned.

📁 Blog Topics:
- Real-world data automation challenges
- Financial and economic data insights
- Reflections on transitioning from finance to data analytics
- Explorations in Python, SQL, VBA, and Power BI
